    <p>Hello there. I will introduce myself. I am an independent person. I have lived in Tijuana, Baja California for a long time. I like the city, it has become my home even though the weather is crazy here.</p>
    <p>I have a Bacherlors degree in Language Teaching. Though after many years of wondering what if's. I have decided to take a chance with programming. I would like to make an application someday. As well as get a more rewarding job.</p>
    <p>The advantages I see from learning about careers in web design, it is more opportunities in the world of technology with personal achievement. I have been working for a company many years. I see they are very demanding and the pay is not good. I would like to be an entrepreneur, with the tools that are being provided I know I will succeed.  </p>
    <p> I like to be at home, resting and watching korean series.</p>We are all on this together. Let's help each other succeed. Happy to see you visited my page.</p>
